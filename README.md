#######################################################################################################

Hi, I am Marie Amor Tamondong, kindly call me Riri for this studying sessions. I graduated as a Computer Engineer and also an IT. Currently in late 20s, working full time in an insurance company as a Tier 1 Support. Before I transferred to IT Service Management, I was a Junior Database Administrator of the same company. I transferred because I think I can't be promoted to the next level since there's a ceiling above me... Unless my Senior resigned... That's the only chance I can get but chances were very slim.

My hobby is cleaning, when I am cleaning stuff, I am also clearing my mind. :D
I also love to play wild rift or mobile legends at my free time. Sometimes I draw digitally but I am not so good at that yet, I still need to practice and learn the tool.

My goal for this year is to know the basics of creating a website and design a functioning website. Hopefully at the end of this year, I can publish my 1st website here.

The reason why I wanna be a web developer is to really shift career for the last time. I don't want to support any longer, also, I don't wanna be involved in the back-end again. My real goal is to get a front-end web developer job as early as 2023.
